1. Move the Chronologies folder outside the .zip file it was sent in.
2. Double click on index.html

Feel free to let me know via email or in class if you have any issues 
getting this to work.

You may find some remnants from a previous website I made that I stole 
the framework to for this one. If you do try a larger window as the mobile

If you see any formatting or technical issues please let me know I would be
happy to fix them.
