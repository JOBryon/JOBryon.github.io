                    <h1>Part of the Dominant Hegemony</h1>
                    Through the systematic rejection of the cultures they originated from. Such as fearing the discourses present in Southern Idaho retaliating and viewing the continuation of teaching either Spanish or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_language">euskara</a> to their children as they were Mexican and not pure-blooded American. The children of immigrants that Joe was hand picked to be descended from, we instilled the feeling of not belonging to any culture into Joe. This to ensure that only conformity to the dominant hegemony that Joe luckily presents as (Good thing he's straight) is the only culture he/him truly belongs to.

                    <h1>Cultures Sustained</h1>

                    <h1>Why Read?</h1>
                    From a young age we heavily promoted reading as an important venue for growth for Joe. Their interest in Fantastical stories reading as much fiction as possible did conflict with the expectations for his future. Luckily choices were made to heavily reduce Joe's ability to creatively express themselves beyond what is desired for a proper American citizen.

                    <h1>A Smart Schooler</h1>
                    From the beginning Joe was shown to be "gifted" at school. Subjects like Math and Science Joe picked up easily. We thought this suited Joe's development as not only does this reinforce typical beliefs about <i>certain genders</i> in K-12 education, but also through how we introduced these subjects pedagogically to Joe we were able to bury Joe's curiosity and remove avenues such as art and writing for Joe to express themselves creatively. Through these pedagogies Joe has been introduced to viewing Math and Science as series of objective facts with no room for inquiry, discovery, or creativity. An effective factory worker following along the path leading to creating <a href="K-12.html">this</a> that treats himself as a product for the system.
