                    <h1>Awareness of Pedagogy</h1>
                    Through handcrafted introduction to the failings of current pedagogy. We tailored the experience of introspection into how pedagogy affected Joe's failure in the game of schooling, and how it continues to fail others who can't play the game in more extreme measures. Contradictory to the moral failing belief within discourse pedagogy and schooling as an enabler of injustice and oppression is a problem Joe is devoted to fixing.

                    <h1>Intersectionality</h1>
                    As an owner of the dominant intersectionality background we believe Joe is in a prime position to reach those who failed school as well. By leveraging the privilege inherently provided that others lack.

                    <h1>Other Cultures Absent</h1>
                    As a member of the field of Computer Science the maleness and whiteness has always been something Joe has been familiar. The direct removal of non-white/male from the history of the field became even more clear as we introduced the reality of schooling.

                    Look at what it can do! It even set up it's own podcast! Computer Science not being based around one demographic and being built off8 women's work. How Novel!
